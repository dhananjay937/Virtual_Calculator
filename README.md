# Math Gesture Recognition and AI Integration System

## Overview

This project combines computer vision, hand gesture recognition, and artificial intelligence to create an interactive tool for solving math problems. Users can draw math problems on a digital canvas using hand gestures, and the system will use AI to provide solutions.

## Features

- Real-time hand tracking and gesture recognition
- Drawing and clearing functionality based on gestures
- Integration with a Generative AI model to interpret drawn content and provide solutions
- Interactive web-based interface built with Streamlit

## Tech Stack

- **Python**: Core programming language
- **Streamlit**: Web-based user interface
- **OpenCV & cvzone**: Real-time video capture and hand gesture recognition
- **Generative AI**: For interpreting drawings and generating solutions
